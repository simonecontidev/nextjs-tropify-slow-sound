### 🎧 Overview

**Tropify** is a **slow-web experience** blending sound, motion, and interaction into a meditative digital journey.  
Built with **Next.js 16 + GSAP + Tailwind**, it transforms scrolling and navigation into a sensory flow — where each scene unfolds like a tropical soundscape.

This project explores the idea of *web as experience*, not interface — balancing performance, visual storytelling, and poetic minimalism.

### 🧠 UX & Creative Direction

Tropify was designed as a **“digital breathing space”** — minimal UI, immersive scroll, fluid rhythm.  
The interface fades away to let light, sound, and color tell the story.  
Every transition is crafted to evoke **calm, curiosity, and flow**.

###  Design Philosophy

“The web can be more than functional — it can be emotional.”

	•	Focus: immersion > interaction
	•	Aesthetic: tropical minimalism, soft gradients, slow transitions
	•	Goal: evoke presence through digital motion
	•	Tone: calm, poetic, meditative
	•	Influence: nature, ocean movement, time perception
